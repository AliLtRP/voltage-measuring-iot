The code is written in Kotlin language for an Android application that displays real-time voltage readings from a Firebase Realtime Database. The app consists of three fragments: ReadingFragment, GraphFragment, and AboutUsFragment. 

The MainActivity sets up the bottom navigation bar and sets the ReadingFragment as the default fragment. It also initializes Firebase in the onCreate method.

The ReadingFragment displays the current voltage reading in a TextView. It listens for changes in the voltage value in the Firebase Realtime Database and updates the TextView accordingly.

The GraphFragment displays a line chart using the MPAndroidChart library, which shows the voltage readings over time. It also listens for changes in the voltage value in the Firebase Realtime Database and updates the chart accordingly.

The AboutUsFragment simply displays information about the app and its creators.

Overall, the code shows how to integrate Firebase Realtime Database and MPAndroidChart library in an Android application to display real-time data in a meaningful way.
